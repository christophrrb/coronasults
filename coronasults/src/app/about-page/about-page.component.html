<h2>About</h2>
<p>This website was created in order to help testing organizations report results in a simple format.</p>

<p>The inspiration for making this website was out of the lack of ease to view results from coronavirus testing. In some testing sites, there is a call center to call everyone for their result, but as this is inefficient, a website would help to let everyone view their results.</p>
